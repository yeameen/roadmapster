# PRD Update Notes - August 2024

## Summary of Implementation Changes

The following features were implemented differently from the original PRD based on user feedback and improved UX design inspired by Jira's sprint planning interface.

## Major Changes from Original PRD

### 1. Multiple Quarter Management
**Original PRD**: Single quarter view with months/sprints division
**Implemented**: Multiple quarters displayed vertically, similar to Jira sprints
- Each quarter is a separate container
- Quarters can be created, edited, and deleted
- No month subdivisions within quarters

### 2. Quarter Lifecycle States
**Original PRD**: Not specified
**Implemented**: Three states for quarters
- **Planning**: Quarter being prepared (gray indicator)
- **Active**: Current working quarter (green indicator)
- **Completed**: Finished quarter (gray badge)

### 3. Collapsible/Expandable Quarters
**Original PRD**: Not specified
**Implemented**: Jira-style collapse/expand functionality
- Collapsed view shows quarter summary (name, capacity, epic count)
- Expanded view shows all epics with drag-drop capability
- Improves focus and reduces visual clutter

### 4. Capacity Visualization Per Quarter
**Original PRD**: Single global capacity meter
**Implemented**: Individual capacity bars for each quarter
- Each quarter shows its own utilization (X/Y days, Z%)
- Color coding: Green (<75%), Orange (75-90%), Red (>90%)
- Real-time updates during drag-and-drop

### 5. Visual Layout
**Original PRD**: Three-column view (Backlog | Quarter with Months | Capacity)
**Implemented**: Two-column view
- Left: Backlog panel with priority grouping
- Right: Quarters panel with vertical quarter stack
- Cleaner, more scalable design

### 6. Quarter-Epic Association
**Original PRD**: Epics assigned to quarter and positioned in months
**Implemented**: Epics assigned to specific quarter with position ordering
- `quarterId` field links epic to quarter
- `position` field maintains order within quarter
- Simpler data model without month tracking

## Benefits of Implementation Changes

1. **Better Scalability**: Can plan multiple quarters ahead
2. **Familiar UX**: Jira users instantly understand the interface
3. **Improved Focus**: Collapse quarters not currently being planned
4. **Clearer Capacity**: Each quarter's capacity is immediately visible
5. **Simpler Data Model**: No need to track month assignments

## Features Maintained As Specified

- Team capacity calculations (vacation, oncall, buffer)
- T-shirt sizing system (XS to XL)
- Priority management (P0-P3)
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Export/Import capability
- Local storage persistence

## Recommended PRD Updates

The PRD should be updated in the following sections:
- Section 3.3: Planning Board - Update to reflect vertical quarter layout
- Section 5.1: Main Dashboard - Update mockup to show multiple quarters
- Section 6.1: Data Model - Add Quarter.status and Quarter.isCollapsed fields
- New Section: Quarter Lifecycle Management

## Future Considerations

Based on the current implementation, consider adding:
1. Quarter templates for quick setup
2. Bulk epic operations (move multiple epics between quarters)
3. Quarter comparison view
4. Velocity tracking across quarters
5. Integration with calendar for quarter date boundaries
