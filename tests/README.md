## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/capacity-planning/drag-drop-epics.spec.ts

# Run tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests with specific project
npx playwright test --project="Desktop Chrome"
```

### Debug Tests
```bash
# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate trace
npx playwright test --trace on

# View test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## üìù Writing Tests

### Using Page Object Model
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/test-base';

test('example test', async ({ page, backlogPage, quartersPage }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  
  // Use page objects for interactions
  await backlogPage.addEpic({
    title: 'New Epic',
    size: 'M',
    priority: 'P1'
  });
  
  await quartersPage.dragEpicToQuarter('New Epic', 'Q1 2025');
  
  // Assertions
  const epics = await quartersPage.getEpicsInQuarter('Q1 2025');
  expect(epics).toContain('New Epic');
});
```

### Using Test Fixtures
```typescript
import { testWithFullSetup } from '../fixtures/test-base';

// This test automatically has default team and quarters
testWithFullSetup('test with setup', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Using Test Data Factory
```typescript
import { test } from '../fixtures/test-base';

test('test with generated data', async ({ testDataFactory }) => {
  const epic = testDataFactory.generateEpic({
    title: 'Custom Epic',
    size: 'L'
  });
  
  const team = testDataFactory.generateTeam(5);
  // Use generated data in test
});
```

## üéØ Test Categories

### Capacity Planning Tests
- Drag and drop epics between backlog and quarters
- Capacity calculations and warnings
- Quarter management operations
- Multi-quarter planning scenarios

### Team Management Tests
- Team creation and configuration
- Member management (add, remove, update)
- Vacation and oncall settings
- Capacity impact of team changes

### Data Persistence Tests
- localStorage operations
- Import/export functionality
- Session persistence
- Data recovery scenarios

### Backlog Management Tests
- Epic creation and editing
- Epic prioritization
- Search and filter operations
- Bulk operations

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Test environment
TEST_ENV=local|staging|production

# Base URL
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# CI/CD
CI=true

# Slow motion for debugging (milliseconds)
SLOW_MO=100

# Storage state for auth
STORAGE_STATE_PATH=./auth-state.json
```

### Playwright Config
The main configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`:
- Multiple browser projects (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
- Parallel execution with 4 workers locally
- Automatic retries on failure
- Screenshots and videos on failure
- HTML and JSON reporters

## üìä Test Reports

### HTML Report
After running tests, view the HTML report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### JSON Report
JSON results are saved to `test-results/results.json`

### Trace Viewer
View test traces for debugging:
```bash
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run test:e2e
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## üèóÔ∏è Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation with its own browser context
2. **Page Object Model**: Use page objects for maintainable tests
3. **Test Data Factory**: Generate consistent test data
4. **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel for speed
5. **Auto-waiting**: Leverage Playwright's auto-wait features
6. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test names
7. **Feature Organization**: Group tests by feature, not type
8. **Custom Fixtures**: Create reusable test setups
9. **Visual Testing**: Use screenshots for visual regression
10. **Cross-browser**: Test across multiple browsers

## üêõ Debugging Tips

1. Use `--debug` flag for step-by-step debugging
2. Add `await page.pause()` to pause execution
3. Use `--headed` to see the browser
4. Enable `--trace on` for detailed traces
5. Check `test-results/` for screenshots and videos
6. Use `console.log()` in tests for debugging
7. Leverage VS Code Playwright extension
